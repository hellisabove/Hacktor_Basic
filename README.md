# Hacktor Basic

Small Zephyr application for the `Hacktor Watch` that brings up a round SPI LCD and capacitive touch panel.

The project currently does four things:

- routes the Zephyr console and shell to the ESP32-S3 native USB serial/JTAG port
- initializes a `GC9A01` 240x240 round LCD over `SPI3`
- initializes a `CST816T`-style touch controller on `I2C`
- runs a minimal LVGL UI that shows `Hello!`, touch coordinates, and a touch indicator dot

## Hardware

Target board:

- `esp32s3_devkitc/esp32s3/procpu`

Connected peripherals:

- LCD controller: `GC9A01`
- Touch controller: `CST816T` using Zephyr's `hynitron,cst816s` driver path

## Pin Mapping

LCD:

- `SPI3_SCK` -> `GPIO12`
- `SPI3_MOSI` -> `GPIO11`
- `SPI3_MISO` -> `GPIO13`
- `LCD_CS` -> `GPIO4`
- `LCD_DC` -> `GPIO5`
- `LCD_RST` -> `GPIO3`
- `LCD_BL` -> `GPIO7`
- `LCD power enable` -> `GPIO18`

Touch:

- `I2C_SDA` -> `GPIO8`
- `I2C_SCL` -> `GPIO9`
- `TP_INT` -> `GPIO1`
- `TP_RST` -> `GPIO2`

These connections are described in [app.overlay](app.overlay).

## What The App Does

On boot, the application:

1. enables the LCD backlight
2. initializes the display after deferred Zephyr device init
3. starts LVGL
4. creates a simple screen with a centered `Hello!` label
5. listens for touch events from the touch controller
6. updates the UI with the current touch position

When the panel is touched:

- a small dot is drawn under the finger
- the bottom status label shows the transformed screen coordinates

When the panel is released:

- the dot is hidden
- the status text changes to `Touch released`

The display is rotated 180 degrees in devicetree so the UI matches the physical mounting orientation.

## Project Structure

- [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt): Zephyr app definition and source list
- [prj.conf](prj.conf): Zephyr Kconfig options for console, shell, LVGL, display, input
- [app.overlay](app.overlay): board-specific devicetree overlay with LCD and touch wiring
- [src/main.c](src/main.c): minimal entry point
- [src/panel.c](src/panel.c): LCD, touch, LVGL, and shell command logic
- [build.sh](build.sh): local build/flash helper script

## Building

The helper script expects a Zephyr workspace layout like this:

- this repository in its current directory
- Zephyr at `../zephyr`
- optional Python virtual environment at `../.venv`

Build:

```bash
./build.sh
```

Clean only:

```bash
./build.sh --clean
```

Pristine rebuild:

```bash
./build.sh --pristine
```

Override the default board if needed:

```bash
BOARD=esp32s3_devkitc/esp32s3/procpu ./build.sh
```

## Flashing

Flash the board:

```bash
./build.sh --flash --port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
```

Optional erase before flashing:

```bash
./build.sh --flash --erase --port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
```

After flashing, the script opens a serial terminal at `115200`.

## USB Console And Shell

The project routes both console and shell to the ESP32-S3 USB serial/JTAG peripheral.

Once connected, Zephyr shell commands are available together with one project-specific command:

```text
app
```

`app` prints the current display geometry, orientation, and the latest touch state.

## Notes

- The LCD panel is configured through Zephyr's `galaxycore,gc9x01x` driver.
- The touch controller is described as `hynitron,cst816s` in devicetree because that is the supported Zephyr driver path used by this hardware setup.
- The application is intentionally small and focused on hardware bring-up rather than product UI structure.

## Setup
- In this repo there are 2 scripts for setting up zephyr 4.3. One is for arch and the other for ubuntu.
- Download the script for your distro, it will setup the zephyr sdk and everything. Then clone the repo in the zephyrproject folder and build it.
